# Node-Learning

The idea behind the project was to learn new techs, and expand my current stack. I'm not implying under any circumstance that I've achieved that goal, but I've definetly
gotten a bit closer to it.

The project is fairly simple,  yet has certain caveats.

It came to be from a friend of mine needing a T&C click-wrap for his website, and its  designed specifically around his web and db models.
The structure might seem strange at first, or might raise the question of "why do things this way", and the answer is pretty simple:
That's the way things were already designed when I started coding.

Also, the DB model is a simplified version of his, used for teaching purposes, not for strict rigurosity.

The main idea behind this, is to get a glimpse at how I process problem solving. The DB calls can be extended to acommodate a BLOB, or to use other factors as auth (since
I'm very much aware just email wont do, but this all happens inside a started session).
